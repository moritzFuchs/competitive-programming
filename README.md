# About

This repository contains some submissions for competitive programming problems I solved. All problems use the [Kattis problem format](http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format) to allow the use of the [problemtools](https://github.com/Kattis/problemtools).

# Installation

First, install the following packages:

```
apt-get install make automake g++ libboost-dev libboost-regex-dev libgmp-dev python-plastex python-yaml
```

Afterwards, execute `make` in the problemtools subdirectory to install the problemtools. Executing `make` in each problem subdirectory checks each problem.
